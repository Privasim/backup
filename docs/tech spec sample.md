# **ConnectSphere: Technical Specification**

Version: 1.0  
Date: September 7, 2025  
Author: Project Team

## **1\. Introduction**

### **1.1. Project Overview**

ConnectSphere is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) social media application designed to provide users with a simple and intuitive platform to connect, share updates, and interact with friends. This document outlines the technical requirements, architecture, and implementation plan for the initial version of the platform.

### **1.2. Goals and Objectives**

* **Primary Goal:** To build a scalable, secure, and user-friendly social media web application.  
* **Objectives:**  
  * Allow users to create and manage personal profiles.  
  * Implement a real-time news feed to display posts from friends.  
  * Enable users to create posts (text and images).  
  * Develop a friendship system (sending, accepting, and removing friend requests).  
  * Ensure the platform is responsive and accessible on modern web browsers.

### **1.3. Scope**

**In-Scope for Version 1.0:**

* User Authentication (Registration, Login, Logout)  
* User Profiles (View and limited Edit)  
* News Feed (Chronological)  
* Post Creation (Text-only to start)  
* Friendship System (Add/Remove Friends)

**Out-of-Scope for Version 1.0:**

* Real-time chat/messaging  
* Groups, Pages, or Events  
* Advanced content types (video, polls, stories)  
* Content moderation tools  
* API for third-party developers

## **2\. System Architecture**

### **2.1. High-Level Architecture**

The system will follow a classic three-tier architecture:

1. **Frontend (Client-Side):** A single-page application (SPA) built with React that handles the user interface and interacts with the backend via a REST API.  
2. **Backend (Server-Side):** A Node.js application using the Express framework to manage business logic, handle API requests, and communicate with the database.  
3. **Database:** A NoSQL database (MongoDB) to store user data, posts, and social graph information.

### **2.2. Technology Stack**

* **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS  
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
* **Database:** MongoDB (using Mongoose for object data modeling)  
* **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)  
* **Deployment:** Docker, AWS (e.g., EC2 for backend, S3 for static assets, DocumentDB/MongoDB Atlas for database)

## **3\. Product Features & Requirements**

### **3.1. User Stories**

* **As a new user,** I want to sign up for an account with my email and password so I can join the platform.  
* **As a user,** I want to log in to my account securely to access my profile and feed.  
* **As a user,** I want to view my own profile to see my posts and information.  
* **As a user,** I want to create a new post with text content so I can share my thoughts with my friends.  
* **As a user,** I want to see a news feed containing posts from my friends in chronological order.  
* **As a user,** I want to search for other users and send them a friend request.  
* **As a user,** I want to accept or decline friend requests from other users.

### **3.2. Functional Requirements**

#### **3.2.1. User Authentication**

* Users must be able to register with a unique email, name, and password.  
* Passwords must be securely hashed before being stored in the database.  
* Users must be able to log in using their email and password.  
* The system will issue a JWT upon successful login for authenticating subsequent API requests.

#### **3.2.2. User Profiles**

* Each user will have a public profile page displaying their name and a list of their posts.  
* Users can only edit their own profile information (e.g., name).

#### **3.2.3. News Feed**

* The main page after login will be the news feed.  
* The feed will display posts from the user's friends, sorted with the newest posts at the top.

#### **3.2.4. Posts**

* Users can create posts containing only text (up to 280 characters).  
* Each post will display the author's name, the content, and a timestamp.  
* Users can delete their own posts.

#### **3.2.5. Friendship System**

* Users can send friend requests to other users who are not already friends.  
* Users can see a list of pending friend requests.  
* Users can accept or reject pending requests.  
* Once a request is accepted, both users become friends.  
* Users can remove a friend from their friend list.

### **3.3. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Performance:** API responses should take less than 500ms on average. The news feed should load within 2 seconds.  
* **Security:** All communication between the client and server must be encrypted using HTTPS. Implement protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF).  
* **Scalability:** The architecture should be designed to handle an initial load of 10,000 users and be horizontally scalable.  
* **Usability:** The UI should be clean, intuitive, and responsive on desktop and mobile browsers.

## **4\. Database Schema**

We will use a NoSQL (MongoDB) schema with the following main collections:

**users collection:**

{  
  "\_id": "ObjectId",  
  "name": "String",  
  "email": "String (unique)",  
  "password": "String (hashed)",  
  "friends": \["ObjectId"\], // Array of user IDs  
  "friendRequests": \["ObjectId"\], // Array of user IDs who sent requests  
  "createdAt": "Timestamp"  
}

**posts collection:**

{  
  "\_id": "ObjectId",  
  "authorId": "ObjectId", // Reference to the user who created it  
  "content": "String",  
  "createdAt": "Timestamp"  
}

## **5\. API Endpoints (REST)**

All endpoints will be prefixed with /api/v1. Authentication is required for all endpoints except for POST /users/register and POST /users/login.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| POST | /users/register | Register a new user. |
| POST | /users/login | Log in a user and return a JWT. |
| GET | /users/:userId | Get profile information for a user. |
| GET | /feed | Get the current user's news feed. |
| POST | /posts | Create a new post. |
| DELETE | /posts/:postId | Delete a post owned by the current user. |
| POST | /friends/request/:userId | Send a friend request to a user. |
| POST | /friends/accept/:userId | Accept a friend request from a user. |
| DELETE | /friends/:userId | Remove a friend. |
