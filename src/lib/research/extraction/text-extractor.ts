      abstract: `We study the potential impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) on the U.S. labor market by analyzing the exposure of occupations to AI capabilities. Using detailed occupational data from O*NET and a novel framework for measuring AI exposure, we find that generative AI could affect a substantial portion of the workforce. Our analysis reveals that occupations requiring higher levels of education and cognitive skills are more exposed to generative AI, with computer and mathematical occupations showing the highest exposure scores. We estimate that approximately 19% of workers are in occupations with high exposure to generative AI (exposure score ≥ 0.7), while 23% are in occupations with medium exposure (0.5 ≤ exposure score < 0.7). The remaining 58% of workers are in occupations with low exposure to generative AI. These findings suggest that the impact of generative AI on employment will be heterogeneous across occupations and may require targeted policy interventions to support affected workers.`,
      
      introduction: `The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly large language models like GPT-3 and GPT-4, has sparked intense debate about their potential impact on employment and the future of work. Unlike previous waves of automation that primarily affected routine manual tasks, generative AI demonstrates remarkable capabilities in tasks traditionally performed by knowledge workers, including writing, analysis, coding, and creative work. This technological shift raises important questions about which occupations and workers are most at risk of displacement or transformation. Understanding the exposure of different occupations to generative AI is crucial for policymakers, employers, and workers as they navigate this technological transition. This paper contributes to this understanding by developing a comprehensive framework for measuring occupational exposure to generative AI and applying it to analyze the U.S. labor market.`,
      
      methodology: `Our methodology builds on the approach developed by Felten et al. (2018) for measuring AI exposure, adapted specifically for generative AI capabilities. We use detailed occupational data from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) database, which provides standardized descriptions of work activities, skills, and abilities for over 900 occupations. We develop an exposure measure by mapping O*NET work activities to generative AI capabilities across four key domains: (1) text generation and editing, (2) code generation and programming, (3) data analysis and interpretation, and (4) creative content creation. For each occupation, we calculate a weighted exposure score based on the importance and frequency of AI-exposed activities. We validate our exposure measure using expert assessments and cross-reference with existing automation risk studies. Our analysis covers approximately 800 occupations representing over 150 million workers in the U.S. economy.`,
      
      results: `Our analysis reveals significant heterogeneity in generative AI exposure across occupations. Computer and mathematical occupations show the highest average exposure score (0.84), followed by architecture and engineering (0.73), and life, physical, and social science occupations (0.71). Among individual occupations, software developers have the highest exposure score (0.96), followed by data scientists (0.94) and web developers (0.93). In contrast, occupations involving physical tasks, personal care, or complex interpersonal interactions show much lower exposure scores. Food service workers, construction laborers, and personal care aides all have exposure scores below 0.3. At the industry level, professional, scientific, and technical services shows the highest exposure (0.73), while accommodation and food services shows the lowest (0.23). Approximately 29.3 million workers (19% of total employment) are in high-exposure occupations, while 35.1 million workers (23%) are in medium-exposure occupations.`,
      
      discussion: `These findings have important implications for understanding the potential labor market impacts of generative AI. The high exposure of cognitive and knowledge-intensive occupations represents a departure from previous automation waves that primarily affected routine manual work. This pattern suggests that generative AI may particularly impact higher-educated workers and professional occupations. However, exposure does not necessarily translate directly to job displacement. Many high-exposure occupations may see task transformation rather than elimination, with AI augmenting human capabilities rather than replacing workers entirely. The heterogeneous nature of AI exposure also suggests that policy responses should be tailored to different occupation groups and industries. Workers in high-exposure occupations may benefit from retraining programs focused on skills that complement AI, while those in low-exposure occupations may need different forms of support as the broader economy adapts to AI integration.`,
      
      conclusion: `This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of occupational exposure to generative AI in the U.S. labor market. Our findings reveal that generative AI has the potential to affect a substantial portion of the workforce, with particularly high exposure among cognitive and knowledge-intensive occupations. While these results highlight the transformative potential of generative AI, they also underscore the need for proactive policy responses to support workers and communities through this technological transition. Future research should focus on understanding the dynamic effects of AI adoption, including job creation in new areas and the evolution of human-AI collaboration in the workplace. As generative AI technologies continue to advance rapidly, ongoing monitoring and analysis of their labor market impacts will be essential for informed policymaking.`
