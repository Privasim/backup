## 🧠 AI SYSTEM INTEGRATION CHECKPOINT

* Profile form outputs should be stored as a `profile_input` JSON block
* LLM function call uses this structure as input for `generateBusinessPlanSummary()`
* Fallback prompts or scoring logic should detect:

  * Missing tools → fallback to general activity mapping
  * Missing tasks → fallback to role + industry model

Would you like this packaged as a PDF/Notion/Markdown spec for your team to implement directly, or should I also prepare a low-fidelity UI wireframe for these flows?
