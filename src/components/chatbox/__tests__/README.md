# Chatbox Testing Implementation

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the profile analysis chatbox feature, implementing task 9 from the profile analysis specification.

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests
- **ChatboxPanel.test.tsx**: Tests for the main panel component including rendering, message display, and user interactions
- **ChatboxControls.test.tsx**: Tests for form controls, validation, and user input handling
- **ChatboxMessage.test.tsx**: Tests for message rendering, formatting, and copy functionality
- **ChatboxProgress.test.tsx**: Tests for progress indicators and status display
- **ChatboxProvider.test.tsx**: Tests for context provider and state management

### Integration Tests
- **integration.test.tsx**: End-to-end workflow tests covering the complete analysis process
- **accessibility.test.tsx**: Comprehensive accessibility testing with axe-core
- **performance.test.tsx**: Performance testing for rendering, updates, and memory usage
- **responsive.test.tsx**: Responsive design testing across different viewport sizes

### Utility Tests
- **content-processor.test.ts**: Tests for content processing and formatting utilities
- **storage-manager.test.ts**: Tests for local storage management and caching

## Accessibility Features Implemented

- Full keyboard accessibility for all interactive elements
- Proper tab order through form controls
- Enter/Space key support for buttons
- Focus management during dynamic content updates

### Screen Reader Support
- Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- Semantic HTML structure with headings
- Status announcements for dynamic content
- Alternative text for visual indicators

### Visual Accessibility
- High contrast color schemes
- Clear focus indicators
- Responsive text sizing
- Proper color contrast ratios

## Performance Optimizations

### Rendering Performance
- React.memo for expensive components
- Efficient re-rendering strategies
- Lazy loading of heavy components
- Optimized bundle splitting

### Memory Management
- Proper cleanup of event listeners
- Cancellation of pending async operations
- Efficient state updates
- Memory leak prevention

### User Experience
- Debounced input handling
- Smooth scrolling animations
- Progressive loading states
- Responsive design patterns

## Responsive Design

### Breakpoints Tested
- Mobile: < 768px
- Tablet: 768px - 1023px
- Desktop: 1024px+
- Large Desktop: 1440px+

### Adaptive Features
- Flexible panel sizing
- Touch-friendly controls on mobile
- Optimized layouts for different screen sizes
- Proper text scaling

## Test Setup

### Mocking Strategy
- External dependencies mocked appropriately
- API calls stubbed with realistic responses
- Local storage mocked for consistent testing
- Component dependencies isolated

### Test Utilities
- Custom render helpers for context providers
- Mock data generators for consistent testing
- Accessibility testing with jest-axe
- Performance measurement utilities

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all chatbox tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="src/components/chatbox/__tests__"

# Run specific test suites
npm test -- --testPathPattern="accessibility.test.tsx"
npm test -- --testPathPattern="performance.test.tsx"
npm test -- --testPathPattern="responsive.test.tsx"

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage --testPathPattern="src/components/chatbox"
```
