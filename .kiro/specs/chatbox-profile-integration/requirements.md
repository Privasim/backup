# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the integration between the new User Profile tab-based flow and the existing Chatbox analysis system. The integration enables AI-powered profile analysis while maintaining the Chatbox as the single orchestration layer for configuration, validation, and analysis execution. The solution preserves the existing premium minimalist UX and robust error handling while providing seamless data flow between the profile system and analysis pipeline.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Chatbox Provider Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ChatboxProvider to accept optional parameters for analysis so that profile data can be passed directly to analysis providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the startAnalysis method is called THEN it SHALL accept optional useStreaming and data parameters
2. WHEN startAnalysis is called with data parameter THEN the system SHALL forward the data to the selected analysis provider
3. WHEN startAnalysis is called without parameters THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing callers
4. WHEN data is provided THEN the system SHALL validate the data format before forwarding to providers
5. IF no data is provided THEN the system SHALL use existing profileData from context

### Requirement 2: Profile Analysis Provider Type Safety

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ProfileAnalysisProvider to safely handle profile data transformations so that analysis requests don't fail due to type errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ProfileAnalysisProvider receives profile data THEN it SHALL safely access all profile fields without throwing errors
2. WHEN profile data contains missing or undefined fields THEN the provider SHALL handle them gracefully with default values
3. WHEN transforming ProfileFormData THEN the system SHALL use the ProfileIntegrationService transformation logic
4. WHEN provider configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the configuration with clear error messages
5. IF streaming is requested but fails THEN the provider SHALL fallback to non-streaming analysis

### Requirement 3: Profile Review Step Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to trigger profile analysis directly from the Review step so that I can get AI insights about my completed profile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Review step renders THEN it SHALL display a ProfileAnalysisTrigger component
2. WHEN the profile is complete and ready for analysis THEN the trigger SHALL be enabled
3. WHEN the profile is incomplete THEN the trigger SHALL be disabled and show missing requirements
4. WHEN the user clicks the analysis trigger THEN the system SHALL open the chatbox and start analysis
5. IF the analysis fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages in the chatbox

### Requirement 4: Profile State Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want my profile changes to be automatically synchronized with the chatbox so that analysis always uses the latest profile data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user saves their profile THEN the system SHALL call setProfileData to update the chatbox context
2. WHEN the profile is reset or cleared THEN the system SHALL clear the profile data in chatbox context
3. WHEN profile data is updated THEN the chatbox SHALL reflect the current profile state
4. WHEN switching between profile tabs THEN the chatbox SHALL maintain the current profile state
5. IF profile synchronization fails THEN the system SHALL log the error without blocking the user workflow

### Requirement 5: Analysis Configuration Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about analysis readiness so that I understand what's needed before I can analyze my profile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Analyze tab is viewed THEN it SHALL show the current profile readiness status
2. WHEN API key or model is missing THEN the system SHALL display clear validation errors
3. WHEN profile data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL show which fields are missing
4. WHEN all requirements are met THEN the system SHALL enable the analysis button
5. IF validation status changes THEN the UI SHALL update immediately to reflect the new state

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want robust error handling during profile analysis so that I can recover from failures and retry analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis fails due to API errors THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry functionality
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL highlight the specific issues
4. WHEN streaming fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to non-streaming analysis
5. IF errors persist THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging

### Requirement 7: Streaming Analysis Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see analysis results in real-time so that I get immediate feedback during the analysis process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN streaming analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL display results as they arrive
2. WHEN streaming is not available THEN the system SHALL fallback to batch analysis
3. WHEN streaming is interrupted THEN the system SHALL preserve partial results
4. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL mark the final result appropriately
5. IF streaming fails THEN the system SHALL retry with non-streaming approach

### Requirement 8: Provider Registration and Initialization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the chatbox system to automatically initialize with the correct providers so that profile analysis is available without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chatbox system initializes THEN it SHALL register the ProfileAnalysisProvider
2. WHEN provider registration fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue with available providers
3. WHEN multiple providers are available THEN the system SHALL select the appropriate provider for the model
4. WHEN no suitable provider is found THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages
5. IF initialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback functionality

### Requirement 9: Data Transformation and Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent data transformation between profile formats so that analysis providers receive properly structured data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN profile data is transformed THEN it SHALL use the ProfileIntegrationService transformation logic
2. WHEN UserProfileData is converted THEN it SHALL map to ProfileAnalysisData format correctly
3. WHEN required fields are missing THEN the transformation SHALL provide sensible defaults
4. WHEN transformation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information
5. IF data formats change THEN the transformation SHALL maintain backward compatibility

### Requirement 10: User Experience and Performance

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth and responsive profile analysis so that the experience feels integrated and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN triggering analysis THEN the response time SHALL be under 2 seconds for UI feedback
2. WHEN analysis is running THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
3. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the profile state SHALL persist correctly
4. WHEN analysis completes THEN the results SHALL be immediately visible
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive UI interactions
