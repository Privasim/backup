# Human vs AI Cost Analysis - Requirements

## Overview
Add a professional cost comparison feature that analyzes the annual cost difference between human workers and AI performing equivalent tasks, integrated into the existing assessment workflow.

## User Journey
1. User completes QuizFormPanel assessment form
2. System triggers cost analysis using real salary and AI pricing data
3. LLM generates contextual cost comparison insights
4. Professional D3 visualization displays the comparison
5. Results integrate seamlessly into ResultsPanel

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Real-Time Salary Data Integration
- **BLS API Integration**: Fetch occupation employment statistics and median wages
- **PayScale API Integration**: Get location-specific salary data with experience adjustments
- **Data Validation**: Ensure salary data accuracy and handle API failures gracefully
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache salary data for performance optimization

### FR2: AI Cost Calculation
- **OpenRouter Pricing**: Calculate AI task costs based on token usage and model pricing
- **Task Frequency Analysis**: LLM determines realistic task automation frequency
- **Annual Cost Projection**: Project yearly costs for both human and AI scenarios
- **Cost Breakdown**: Detailed breakdown of AI infrastructure and usage costs

### FR3: LLM-Powered Analysis
- **Contextual Insights**: Generate industry-specific cost comparison analysis
- **Risk Assessment Integration**: Combine cost data with existing risk analysis
- **Recommendation Engine**: Provide actionable insights based on cost differential
- **Source Attribution**: Include data sources and confidence levels

### FR4: Professional Visualization
- **Single D3 Chart**: Modern, interactive cost comparison visualization
- **Responsive Design**: Works across all device sizes
- **Export Capability**: SVG export for professional reporting
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

### FR5: Modular Architecture
- **Dedicated Module**: `src/lib/cost-analysis/` folder structure
- **Service Layer**: Independent CostAnalysisService
- **API Abstraction**: Pluggable API providers for future expansion
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and fallback strategies

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance
- **API Response Time**: < 3 seconds for cost analysis completion
- **Caching**: 24-hour cache for salary data, 1-hour for AI pricing
- **Concurrent Requests**: Handle multiple simultaneous analyses

### NFR2: Reliability
- **API Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
- **Data Validation**: Validate all external API responses
- **Error Recovery**: Retry mechanisms for transient failures

### NFR3: Security
- **API Key Management**: Secure handling of external API credentials
- **Data Privacy**: No storage of personal salary information
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits and implement backoff

### NFR4: Maintainability
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests for all components
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive code documentation

## Integration Requirements

### IR1: QuizFormPanel Integration
- Trigger cost analysis after form completion
- Pass user profile data to cost analysis service
- Display loading states during analysis

### IR2: ResearchDataService Integration
- Use existing occupation data for context
- Leverage risk analysis for cost projections
- Maintain consistency with existing data models

### IR3: ResultsPanel Integration
- Add cost comparison section to results
- Maintain existing layout and styling
- Ensure responsive behavior

## Data Requirements

### DR1: Salary Data Sources
- **Primary**: BLS Occupational Employment Statistics
- **Secondary**: PayScale API for location/experience adjustments
- **Fallback**: Hardcoded salary ranges from quiz data

### DR2: AI Cost Data
- **OpenRouter Pricing**: Real-time model pricing
- **Token Usage**: Estimated tokens per task
- **Infrastructure Costs**: Additional AI deployment costs

### DR3: Analysis Context
- **Occupation Details**: From ResearchDataService
- **Industry Context**: From user profile
- **Risk Factors**: From existing risk analysis

## Success Criteria
1. **Accuracy**: Cost comparisons within 15% of manual calculations
2. **Performance**: Complete analysis in under 3 seconds
3. **Reliability**: 99% uptime with graceful API failure handling
4. **User Experience**: Seamless integration with existing workflow
5. **Professional Quality**: Export-ready visualizations for business use
