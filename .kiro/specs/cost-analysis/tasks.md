2. AI cost calculation with OpenRouter pricing
3. Basic D3 visualization
4. ResultsPanel integration

### Enhanced Features (Should Have)
1. PayScale API for location adjustments
2. LLM-generated insights and recommendations
3. Advanced visualization features
4. Comprehensive error handling

### Future Enhancements (Could Have)
1. Additional salary data sources
2. Industry-specific cost factors
3. Historical cost trend analysis
4. Export to PDF/Excel functionality

## Success Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Cost calculations within 15% of manual verification
- **Performance**: Complete analysis in under 3 seconds
- **Reliability**: 95% success rate with graceful fallbacks
- **User Experience**: Seamless integration with existing workflow
- **Code Quality**: 90%+ test coverage, TypeScript strict mode

## Dependencies
