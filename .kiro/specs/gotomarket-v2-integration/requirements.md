# Go-to-Market V2 Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This feature integrates AI-powered go-to-market strategy generation into the existing GoToMarketV2Content component. The system will leverage the implementation plan context from ListTab to generate comprehensive go-to-market strategies including marketing, sales, distribution, and pricing strategies using the existing ChatboxControls and OpenRouter infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Context Integration

**User Story:** As a business strategist, I want the go-to-market generator to use the implementation plan context from ListTab, so that the generated strategies are aligned with my business implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user has a successful implementation plan in ListTab THEN the go-to-market generator SHALL access the plan's textContent, structured data, and metadata
2. WHEN no implementation plan exists THEN the system SHALL display a contextual message directing users to generate a plan first
3. WHEN the implementation plan is updated THEN the go-to-market context SHALL automatically refresh to reflect changes
4. IF the implementation plan contains business goals, phases, and tasks THEN these SHALL be used as input context for strategy generation

### Requirement 2: AI-Powered Strategy Generation

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to generate comprehensive go-to-market strategies using AI, so that I can quickly develop marketing, sales, and distribution plans.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Generate Go-to-Market" THEN the system SHALL use ChatboxControls API configuration to call OpenRouter
2. WHEN generating strategies THEN the system SHALL create marketing strategies, sales channels, pricing models, and distribution plans
3. WHEN generation is in progress THEN the system SHALL display real-time streaming progress with visual indicators
4. IF generation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with retry options
5. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL cache results for future access

### Requirement 3: Comprehensive Strategy Output

**User Story:** As a marketing manager, I want detailed go-to-market strategies with actionable insights, so that I can implement effective market entry plans.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN strategies are generated THEN the system SHALL provide marketing strategies with tactics, costs, and timeframes
2. WHEN sales channels are created THEN each SHALL include implementation steps, cost structures, and suitability scores
3. WHEN pricing strategies are generated THEN they SHALL include multiple models with pros, cons, and market fit analysis
4. WHEN distribution plans are created THEN they SHALL align with implementation timeline phases
5. IF tool recommendations are provided THEN they SHALL include integration complexity and cost estimates

### Requirement 4: Interactive Strategy Management

**User Story:** As a business strategist, I want to interact with generated strategies, so that I can customize and track implementation progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing strategies THEN the user SHALL be able to mark items as completed or in-progress
2. WHEN strategies are modified THEN changes SHALL be persisted locally with timestamps
3. WHEN exporting strategies THEN the system SHALL support JSON and Markdown formats
4. IF multiple strategy versions exist THEN the user SHALL be able to compare and revert changes
5. WHEN sharing strategies THEN the system SHALL provide copy-to-clipboard functionality

### Requirement 5: Organized Feature Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the go-to-market feature properly organized in its own module, so that it's maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the feature THEN all components SHALL be organized under `src/features/gotomarket-v2/`
2. WHEN creating services THEN they SHALL follow existing patterns from implementation-plan and chatbox features
3. WHEN adding types THEN they SHALL be properly typed with TypeScript interfaces
4. IF hooks are needed THEN they SHALL follow React best practices and be reusable
5. WHEN testing THEN the feature SHALL include unit tests for core functionality

### Requirement 6: UI/UX Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the go-to-market interface to be intuitive and consistent with the existing application design, so that I can efficiently navigate and use the features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component loads THEN it SHALL display a prominent "Generate Go-to-Market" button when context is available
2. WHEN generation is active THEN the UI SHALL show streaming progress with appropriate loading states
3. WHEN strategies are displayed THEN they SHALL use consistent card layouts and visual hierarchy
4. IF errors occur THEN they SHALL be displayed with clear messaging and recovery options
5. WHEN the feature is ready for future enhancements THEN the UI SHALL accommodate additional strategy types and customization options
