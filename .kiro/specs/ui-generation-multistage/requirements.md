# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the existing single-stage UI generation system into a comprehensive multi-stage workflow that converts natural language prompts into production-ready mobile UI previews. The system will guide users through four distinct stages: Design Specification, Requirements Generation, Wireframe Creation, and Frontend Rendering, with streaming feedback, cancellation support, and comprehensive error handling throughout the process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Stage Workflow Orchestration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate mobile UIs through a structured multi-stage process, so that I can have better control over the generation process and review intermediate outputs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates UI generation THEN the system SHALL present a 4-stage workflow: Design Spec, Requirements, Wireframe, and Frontend
2. WHEN a user completes a stage THEN the system SHALL allow them to review and edit the output before proceeding
3. WHEN a user approves a stage output THEN the system SHALL automatically proceed to the next stage
4. WHEN a user cancels generation at any stage THEN the system SHALL immediately abort the current operation and preserve completed stages
5. IF a stage fails THEN the system SHALL allow retry or manual editing before continuing

### Requirement 2: Design Specification Generation (Stage 1)

**User Story:** As a user, I want to convert my natural language prompt into a structured design specification, so that I have a clear foundation for the UI generation process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a prompt THEN the system SHALL generate a DesignSpecDoc with streaming JSON output
2. WHEN generating the spec THEN the system SHALL include title, summary, target audience, goals, navigation, layout guidelines, component inventory, interactions, data bindings, style tokens, accessibility, and performance considerations
3. WHEN streaming the spec THEN the system SHALL provide real-time metrics including chunks, bytes, and timing
4. WHEN the spec is complete THEN the system SHALL validate it against the DesignSpecDoc schema
5. IF the spec is invalid THEN the system SHALL retry once with a tighter prompt

### Requirement 3: Requirements Derivation (Stage 2)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically derive 8-10 specific requirements from the design specification, so that I have clear acceptance criteria for the UI implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a design spec is approved THEN the system SHALL generate exactly 8-10 RequirementTask items
2. WHEN generating requirements THEN each task SHALL include id, title, description, acceptance criteria, priority (P0/P1/P2), status, dependencies, and estimates
3. WHEN requirements are generated THEN they SHALL be directly derived from the approved design specification
4. WHEN requirements are displayed THEN users SHALL be able to review them as a checklist
5. IF requirements generation fails THEN the system SHALL allow users to return to design spec editing

### Requirement 4: Wireframe Generation (Stage 3)

**User Story:** As a designer, I want to generate a detailed wireframe DSL from the design spec and requirements, so that I can see the structural layout before final rendering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requirements are approved THEN the system SHALL generate a WireframeScreen with streaming output
2. WHEN generating wireframes THEN the system SHALL use the approved design spec and requirements as input
3. WHEN wireframes are generated THEN they SHALL include viewport settings, design tokens, nodes, view states, actions, and data bindings
4. WHEN wireframes are complete THEN they SHALL be validated against the WireframeScreen schema
5. IF wireframe generation fails THEN the system SHALL allow users to return to previous stages for editing

### Requirement 5: Enhanced UI Rendering (Stage 4)

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a high-fidelity mobile preview of my generated UI, so that I can evaluate the final result before export.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a wireframe is generated THEN the system SHALL render it using UIRendererV2 with enhanced component support
2. WHEN rendering THEN the system SHALL support Screen, Navbar, Header, Card, List, ListItem, Tabs, Chip, Stat, ChartPlaceholder, Form, TextField, Button, SegmentedControl, Avatar, Icon, and ModalSheet components
3. WHEN rendering THEN the system SHALL apply design tokens for colors, typography, radii, and shadows to Tailwind utility classes
4. WHEN rendering THEN the system SHALL provide simple interactivity including tab switching, modal toggle, and button press feedback
5. WHEN rendering is complete THEN users SHALL have the option to generate a code blueprint for export

### Requirement 6: Responsive Layout Architecture

**User Story:** As a user, I want the UI generation interface to be organized in a clear two-column layout, so that I can see the preview and controls simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MobileTab loads THEN the system SHALL display a responsive 2-column grid layout
2. WHEN displaying the layout THEN the left column SHALL contain the phone preview container
3. WHEN displaying the layout THEN the right column SHALL contain a vertical stepper with 4 collapsible panels
4. WHEN panels are displayed THEN they SHALL be organized as: Prompt (compact), Design Spec, Requirements, and Frontend panels
5. IF the screen is too narrow THEN the layout SHALL stack vertically while maintaining usability

### Requirement 7: Streaming and Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time progress during generation, so that I understand the system is working and can monitor performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any stage is generating content THEN the system SHALL display streaming text output with incremental JSON parsing
2. WHEN streaming THEN the system SHALL show real-time metrics including start time, chunks received, bytes processed, and current timing
3. WHEN parsing JSON THEN the system SHALL use brace-balance detection to handle partial responses
4. WHEN streaming completes THEN the system SHALL throttle setState calls and batch UI updates for performance
5. IF streaming is cancelled THEN the system SHALL immediately close the reader and clear the abort controller

### Requirement 8: Comprehensive Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and recovery options when generation fails, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any stage encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display a concise, actionable error message
2. WHEN schema validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight the specific fields that caused the error
3. WHEN a stage fails THEN the system SHALL offer retry options or allow manual editing of previous stages
4. WHEN API responses are invalid THEN the system SHALL attempt one non-streaming retry with a tighter prompt
5. IF all retry attempts fail THEN the system SHALL preserve user progress and allow manual intervention

### Requirement 9: State Management and Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my generation progress to be preserved across sessions, so that I don't lose work if I need to refresh or return later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generation is in progress THEN the system SHALL maintain state for current stage, spec document, tasks, wireframe, blueprint, stream data, errors, and abort controller
2. WHEN artifacts are generated THEN the system SHALL cache them in localStorage using stable hashes of inputs
3. WHEN users return to the interface THEN the system SHALL restore their previous session state if available
4. WHEN model selection changes THEN the system SHALL persist the choice in localStorage with the key 'ui-prompt:selected-model'
5. IF localStorage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade without caching

### Requirement 10: Security and Code Safety

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure that generated code is never executed at runtime, so that the application remains secure from code injection attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code blueprints are generated THEN the system SHALL only display them as text for export purposes
2. WHEN rendering wireframes THEN the system SHALL never use eval() or similar dynamic code execution
3. WHEN displaying user content THEN the system SHALL sanitize all text to prevent HTML injection
4. WHEN managing API keys THEN the system SHALL use the existing ChatboxControls and useChatboxSettings infrastructure
5. WHEN handling user input THEN the system SHALL validate and escape all content before processing
