# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a dedicated "Implementation Plan" tab that displays the same markdown content generated in the ChatboxPanel when users click "Create Implementation Plan" from a business suggestion card. The tab will provide a clean, focused view of the generated implementation plan content, automatically switching to this tab once generation completes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view generated implementation plans in a dedicated tab, so that I can focus on the plan content without the chatbox interface distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Create Implementation Plan" on a SuggestionCard THEN the system SHALL generate the plan in the chatbox AND automatically switch to the new Implementation Plan tab once generation completes
2. WHEN the implementation plan generation is streaming in the chatbox THEN the Implementation Plan tab SHALL display the same streaming content in real-time
3. WHEN the implementation plan generation completes THEN the Implementation Plan tab SHALL display the final markdown content in the same format as the chatbox
4. WHEN a user switches to the Implementation Plan tab manually THEN the system SHALL display the most recently generated plan content or an empty state if no plan exists

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Implementation Plan tab to be easily accessible, so that I can quickly navigate to view my generated plans.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tab navigation is displayed THEN the Implementation Plan tab SHALL be visible with an appropriate icon and label
2. WHEN a user clicks the Implementation Plan tab THEN the system SHALL switch to display the implementation plan content
3. WHEN no implementation plan has been generated THEN the tab SHALL display an empty state with instructions to generate a plan
4. WHEN multiple plans have been generated THEN the tab SHALL display the most recent plan content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Implementation Plan tab content to be synchronized with the chatbox generation, so that I see consistent content across both interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementation plan generation starts in the chatbox THEN the Implementation Plan tab SHALL show a loading state
2. WHEN content is streaming in the chatbox THEN the Implementation Plan tab SHALL receive and display the same streaming chunks
3. WHEN generation completes successfully THEN both the chatbox and Implementation Plan tab SHALL display identical final content
4. WHEN generation fails THEN the Implementation Plan tab SHALL display an appropriate error state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Implementation Plan tab to provide additional functionality beyond just viewing, so that I can interact with the generated content effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a generated plan THEN the user SHALL be able to copy the markdown content to clipboard
2. WHEN viewing a generated plan THEN the user SHALL be able to download the content as a markdown file
3. WHEN viewing a generated plan THEN the user SHALL be able to regenerate the plan with the same business suggestion
4. WHEN the plan content is long THEN the tab SHALL provide smooth scrolling and proper formatting for readability
