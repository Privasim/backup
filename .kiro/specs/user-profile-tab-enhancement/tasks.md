## Dependencies & Risks

### Technical Dependencies
- Existing ProfileContext and storage systems
- QuizForm components (Dropdown, SkillSelector)
- Design system and styling framework
- TypeScript and React ecosystem

### Risk Mitigation
- **Data Migration Risk**: Implement backward compatibility and gradual migration
- **Performance Risk**: Use lazy loading and optimization techniques
- **Integration Risk**: Maintain existing API contracts and add adapters
- **UX Risk**: Conduct user testing and iterate based on feedback
