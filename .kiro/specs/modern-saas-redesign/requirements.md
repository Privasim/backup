# Modern SaaS Redesign Requirements

## Overview
Transform the existing quiz page interface from a debug-focused layout to a modern, professional SaaS application aesthetic while maintaining 100% of current functionality.

## Current State Analysis
- **Layout**: 3-panel debug interface with technical appearance
- **Visual Style**: Developer-focused with gray backgrounds and utilitarian design
- **User Experience**: Functional but lacks modern SaaS polish
- **Target Users**: Currently optimized for developers, needs to appeal to business users

## Design Goals
1. **Modern SaaS Aesthetic**: Clean, professional interface matching industry standards (Linear, Notion, Figma)
2. **Enhanced Visual Hierarchy**: Clear information architecture with improved typography and spacing
3. **Professional Color Palette**: Move from debug grays to sophisticated brand colors
4. **Improved User Experience**: Streamlined workflows with better visual feedback
5. **Enterprise-Ready**: Professional appearance suitable for business presentations

## Functional Requirements (No Changes)
- All existing form validation and step progression
- Complete analysis workflow and progress tracking
- All visualization components and export functionality
- Debug console and research transparency features
- Cost analysis integration
- Responsive design across all breakpoints

## Visual Design Requirements

### Color System
- **Primary Brand**: Deep blue (#1E40AF) for primary actions and branding
- **Secondary**: Emerald green (#059669) for success states and positive metrics
- **Accent**: Violet (#7C3AED) for highlights and interactive elements
- **Neutral**: Sophisticated grays (#F8FAFC, #E2E8F0, #64748B, #1E293B)
- **Semantic**: Amber (#D97706) warnings, Rose (#E11D48) errors

### Typography

### Layout Principles
- **Card-based Design**: Elevated surfaces with subtle shadows
- **Generous Whitespace**: Improved breathing room between elements
