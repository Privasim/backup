## Implementation Strategy

### Frontend-First Development Approach
- **Complete Client-Side Implementation**: Build full UI/UX experience with no backend dependencies
- **Local State Management**: Extend current ProfileContext for complex wizard state
- **Client-Side Validation**: Comprehensive Zod validation with conditional rules
- **localStorage Persistence**: Robust data storage with draft management and recovery
- **Interface-Only Integration**: Define service contracts without implementation

### Architecture Principles
- **Modular Design**: Components that can be easily extended and modified
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, validation, and data management
- **Future-Ready Interfaces**: Service contracts ready for seamless backend integration
- **Performance-First**: Optimized rendering, lazy loading, and efficient state updates
- **Accessibility-First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance built into every component

### Development Priorities
1. **Extend Current Implementation**: Build on existing ProfilePanel and ProfileContext
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Add features incrementally without breaking existing functionality
3. **Client-Side Focus**: Complete all functionality without external API dependencies
4. **Interface Preparation**: Define clear contracts for future backend integration
5. **User Experience**: Prioritize smooth, intuitive form interactions

### Quality Standards
