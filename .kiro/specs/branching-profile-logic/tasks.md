# Branching Profile Logic - Frontend Implementation Tasks

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Enhancement
- [ ] **Expand ProfileType enum** - Add career-shifter, entrepreneur, other to existing types
- [ ] **Enhanced ProfileData interface** - Extend current Profile interface with conditional fields
- [ ] **Conditional validation schemas** - Create Zod schemas with dynamic field validation
- [ ] **Enhanced ProfileContext** - Extend current context with wizard state and persistence
- [ ] **localStorage utilities** - Add draft auto-save, completion tracking, and data recovery
- [ ] **Field configuration system** - Create centralized field definitions and branching rules

## Phase 2: Dynamic Form Logic Implementation
- [ ] **ConditionalFieldsStep component** - New component for dynamic field rendering
- [ ] **Field rendering engine** - Smart component that renders fields based on profile type
- [ ] **Branching logic system** - Client-side rule engine using CONDITIONAL_FIELD_CONFIG
- [ ] **Enhanced ProfileWizard** - Multi-step navigation with conditional progression
- [ ] **Real-time validation** - Immediate feedback with Zod schema validation
- [ ] **Form state management** - Complex form state with step validation and error handling

## Phase 3: Experience & Skills Enhancement
- [ ] **Enhanced ExperienceStep** - Build on current step with multiple entry types
- [ ] **ExperienceEntry components** - Work, education, project, volunteer entry forms
- [ ] **Enhanced SkillsStep** - Extend current SkillsetSelector with categories and proficiency
- [ ] **Skill management system** - Advanced skill selection with search and filtering
- [ ] **Certification tracking** - New certification management with validation
- [ ] **Language proficiency** - Multi-language support with standard proficiency levels
- [ ] **Data normalization** - Utilities for consistent data structure and validation

## Phase 4: UI/UX Enhancement
- [ ] **Enhanced ProfilePanel UI** - Improve current panel with better layout and interactions
- [ ] **Mobile-first responsive design** - Optimize form experience for all screen sizes
- [ ] **Accessibility implementation** - ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- [ ] **Visual design consistency** - Align with existing design system and component patterns
- [ ] **Loading and transition states** - Smooth animations, skeleton screens, progress indicators
- [ ] **Error boundary implementation** - Comprehensive error handling and user-friendly recovery
- [ ] **Form UX improvements** - Better field focus, validation feedback, and user guidance

## Phase 5: Future Integration Preparation (Interface Only)
- [ ] **Service interface definitions** - TypeScript interfaces for future LLM services
- [ ] **Data transformation utilities** - Interface definitions for API format conversion
- [ ] **PostSubmissionPanel** - New component with placeholder action buttons
- [ ] **Future action placeholders** - UI components for backup plans, business ideas, etc.
- [ ] **Event system hooks** - Prepare hooks for future analytics and tracking
- [ ] **API client interfaces** - Define contracts for future backend integration
- [ ] **Configuration system** - Extensible system for future field types and rules

## Phase 6: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] **Unit tests** - Validation schemas, utilities, state management
- [ ] **Component tests** - Form interactions, conditional rendering
- [ ] **Integration tests** - Multi-step form flow, data persistence
- [ ] **Accessibility testing** - Screen reader, keyboard navigation
- [ ] **Documentation** - Component API docs, integration guide

## Implementation Strategy

### Frontend-First Development Approach
- **Complete Client-Side Implementation**: Build full UI/UX experience with no backend dependencies
- **Local State Management**: Extend current ProfileContext for complex wizard state
- **Client-Side Validation**: Comprehensive Zod validation with conditional rules
- **localStorage Persistence**: Robust data storage with draft management and recovery
- **Interface-Only Integration**: Define service contracts without implementation

### Architecture Principles
- **Modular Design**: Components that can be easily extended and modified
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, validation, and data management
- **Future-Ready Interfaces**: Service contracts ready for seamless backend integration
- **Performance-First**: Optimized rendering, lazy loading, and efficient state updates
- **Accessibility-First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance built into every component

### Development Priorities
1. **Extend Current Implementation**: Build on existing ProfilePanel and ProfileContext
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Add features incrementally without breaking existing functionality
3. **Client-Side Focus**: Complete all functionality without external API dependencies
4. **Interface Preparation**: Define clear contracts for future backend integration
5. **User Experience**: Prioritize smooth, intuitive form interactions

### Quality Standards
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and accessibility testing
- **Performance Optimization**: Code splitting, memoization, and efficient re-renders
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Support for all modern browsers
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive design optimized for mobile devices
- **Documentation**: Clear component APIs and integration guides
