# Branching Profile Logic - Implementation Tasks

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- [ ] **Expand ProfileType enum** - Add missing types (career-shifter, entrepreneur, other)
- [ ] **Enhanced ProfileData interface** - Add conditional fields for all profile types  
- [ ] **Zod validation schemas** - Create conditional validation per profile type
- [ ] **Update ProfileContext** - Extend state management for new data structure
- [ ] **Local storage utilities** - Add persistence layer with draft/complete states

## Phase 2: Conditional Form Logic
- [ ] **ConditionalFieldsStep component** - Dynamic field rendering based on profile type
- [ ] **Field registry system** - Centralized field definitions and validation rules
- [ ] **Branching logic engine** - Rule-based field display with max 3-level depth
- [ ] **Enhanced form navigation** - Step validation gates and progress tracking
- [ ] **Real-time validation** - Field-level and form-level error handling

## Phase 3: Experience & Skills Enhancement
- [ ] **ExperienceEntry components** - Work, education, project, volunteer tracking
- [ ] **Enhanced SkillsStep** - Skill categories, proficiency levels, years experience
- [ ] **Certification tracking** - Add certification management with validation
- [ ] **Language proficiency** - Multi-language support with standard levels
- [ ] **Data transformation utils** - Normalize data for storage and future API integration

## Phase 4: UI/UX Polish
- [ ] **Mobile-first responsive design** - Optimize for all screen sizes
- [ ] **Accessibility compliance** - ARIA labels, keyboard nav, screen reader support
- [ ] **Visual design system** - Consistent styling with existing components
- [ ] **Loading states** - Skeleton screens and progress indicators
- [ ] **Error boundary** - Graceful error handling and recovery

## Phase 5: Integration Readiness
- [ ] **Service layer stubs** - Create placeholder services for future LLM integration
- [ ] **Data transformation layer** - Structure data for future API consumption
- [ ] **PostSubmissionPanel** - Action buttons with placeholder functionality
- [ ] **Event tracking hooks** - Prepare analytics events for user interactions
- [ ] **Configuration interfaces** - Define contracts for future backend integration

## Phase 6: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] **Unit tests** - Validation schemas, utilities, state management
- [ ] **Component tests** - Form interactions, conditional rendering
- [ ] **Integration tests** - Multi-step form flow, data persistence
- [ ] **Accessibility testing** - Screen reader, keyboard navigation
- [ ] **Documentation** - Component API docs, integration guide

## Implementation Focus

### Frontend-First Approach
- Build complete UI/UX experience with local state management
- Implement all form logic and validation without external dependencies
- Create comprehensive data models ready for future API integration
- Design service layer interfaces without actual implementation

### Future-Proof Architecture
- Structure components for easy LLM service integration
- Design data models compatible with database schemas
- Create clear separation between UI logic and data processing
- Implement extensible validation system for new field types

### Integration Preparation
- Define service contracts for future backend endpoints
- Structure data transformation utilities for API compatibility
- Create placeholder components for LLM-powered features
- Design event system for future analytics integration

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for form steps to reduce initial bundle size
- Memoization for expensive form components and validation
- Debounced auto-save to prevent excessive localStorage operations
- Code splitting for validation schemas and heavy dependencies

### Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive test coverage for all form logic
- Accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile-first responsive design validation
