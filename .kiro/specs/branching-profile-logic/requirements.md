# Branching Profile Logic - Frontend Requirements

## Overview
Enhance the existing ProfilePanel and ProfileContext to implement sophisticated client-side branching form logic. The system will collect structured, non-PII profile data through an intuitive multi-step wizard, with all processing happening on the frontend while maintaining interfaces for future backend integration.

## Primary Goals
1. **Frontend-First Implementation**: Build complete UI/UX experience with no backend dependencies
2. **Expand Profile Types**: Extend current 6 types to 8 with sophisticated conditional branching
3. **Dynamic Form Logic**: Implement client-side rule engine for adaptive question flow
4. **Enhanced Data Collection**: Capture comprehensive skills, experience, and qualifications
5. **Future-Ready Architecture**: Design service interfaces and data contracts for seamless backend integration
6. **Privacy-First**: Maintain anonymous, client-side-only data storage approach

## Enhanced User Flow
1. User clicks profile avatar to open enhanced ProfilePanel
2. User selects from 8 profile types in improved dropdown interface
3. Conditional questions dynamically appear based on selection with smooth transitions
4. Multi-step wizard guides through: Profile Details → Experience → Skills → Review
5. Real-time validation provides immediate feedback at field and form levels
6. Auto-save preserves progress with draft state management
7. Completion triggers PostSubmissionPanel with success confirmation
8. Placeholder action buttons prepare for future LLM-powered features

## Core Requirements

### Profile Types (Expanded)
- Working Full-Time
- Working Part-Time  
- Freelancer
- Student
- Unemployed (Actively Searching)
- Career Shifter
- Entrepreneur
- Other (with text input)

### Conditional Branching Logic
- **Student**: Major, graduation year, skills, interested industries
- **Working Full-Time**: Industry, role, experience years, skills, technologies
- **Entrepreneur**: Business stage, industry, team size, no-code familiarity
- **Career Shifter**: Previous career, years in previous role, target industry
- **Others**: Relevant contextual fields based on selection

### Enhanced Data Structure (Building on Current Profile Interface)
```typescript
interface ProfileFormData {
  profile: ProfileData;           // Enhanced with conditional fields
  experience: ExperienceEntry[];  // Work, education, projects, volunteer
  skillset: EnhancedSkillset;     // Categories, proficiency, certifications
  metadata: {
    completedAt?: string;
    lastModified: string;
    version: string;
    isDraft: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Future Action Placeholders (UI Only)
- **Create a Backup Plan**: Analyze profile for alternative career paths
- **Suggest a Startup Idea**: Generate business ideas based on skills/experience  
- **Explore Industry Fit**: Assess compatibility with different industries
- **Generate Personal Learning Path**: Create customized skill development roadmap
- **Export Profile Data**: Download structured profile for external use

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Implementation
- **Framework**: React + TypeScript extending current ProfilePanel/ProfileContext architecture
- **Validation**: Zod schemas with conditional validation based on profile type
- **State Management**: Enhanced ProfileContext with wizard state and persistence
- **Storage**: localStorage with draft auto-save and completion tracking
- **Styling**: Consistent with existing design system and component patterns
- **Performance**: Code splitting, lazy loading, and optimized re-renders
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with full keyboard navigation

### Future Integration Interfaces (No Implementation)
- **Service Contracts**: TypeScript interfaces for future LLM integration
- **Data Transformation**: Utilities for API format conversion (interface only)
- **Event System**: Hooks for future analytics and tracking integration
- **Configuration**: Extensible field and validation configuration system

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Privacy**: Zero PII collection, anonymous client-side storage only
- **Performance**: Form completion under 3 minutes, < 2s step transitions
- **Reliability**: Graceful error handling, offline capability, data recovery
- **Scalability**: Support for future field types and validation rules
- **Maintainability**: Modular architecture, comprehensive testing, clear documentation
