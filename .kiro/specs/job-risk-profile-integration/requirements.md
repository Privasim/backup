# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates user profile data with job risk analysis by connecting the User Profile ReviewStep to the ResearchDataService through the existing Chatbox analysis system. Users can trigger personalized job risk analysis directly from their completed profile, with results displayed in the JobRiskAnalysisTab using real data instead of placeholders. The system leverages existing infrastructure while adding intelligent profile-to-occupation mapping and seamless data flow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Job Risk Analysis Trigger

**User Story:** As a user who has completed my profile, I want to analyze my job risk so that I can understand how AI automation might affect my specific role and skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ReviewStep renders THEN the system SHALL display a "Analyze Job Risk" button alongside the existing profile analysis trigger
2. WHEN the user's profile is complete THEN the job risk analysis button SHALL be enabled
3. WHEN the profile is incomplete THEN the job risk analysis button SHALL be disabled with clear messaging
4. WHEN the user clicks "Analyze Job Risk" THEN the system SHALL trigger job risk analysis through the chatbox system
5. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL navigate to or highlight the JobRiskAnalysisTab with results

### Requirement 2: Profile-to-Occupation Mapping Service

**User Story:** As a system, I want to intelligently map user profile data to occupation identifiers so that I can query relevant job risk data from the research service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user profile contains role and industry data THEN the system SHALL generate occupation search queries for ResearchDataService
2. WHEN mapping Professional roles THEN the system SHALL combine jobFunction, seniority, and industry to create occupation identifiers
3. WHEN mapping Student profiles THEN the system SHALL use fieldOfStudy and career goals to predict target occupations
4. WHEN mapping Business Owner profiles THEN the system SHALL analyze sector and role to identify relevant occupations
5. WHEN mapping Career Shifter profiles THEN the system SHALL analyze both previousField and desiredField for comprehensive risk assessment

### Requirement 3: Job Risk Analysis Provider

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a specialized analysis provider that processes job risk requests so that the chatbox system can handle job risk analysis alongside profile analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chatbox system initializes THEN it SHALL register a JobRiskAnalysisProvider
2. WHEN job risk analysis is requested THEN the provider SHALL use the ProfileOccupationMapper to identify relevant occupations
3. WHEN occupation identifiers are available THEN the provider SHALL query ResearchDataService for risk data, industry exposure, and skill automation data
4. WHEN research data is retrieved THEN the provider SHALL generate a comprehensive job risk report using AI analysis
5. WHEN analysis completes THEN the provider SHALL store results for JobRiskAnalysisTab consumption

### Requirement 4: Enhanced JobRiskAnalysisTab Integration

**User Story:** As a user viewing job risk analysis, I want to see real data based on my profile so that I get personalized and actionable insights about my job security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JobRiskAnalysisTab loads THEN it SHALL check for available job risk analysis results
2. WHEN real analysis data is available THEN the system SHALL replace placeholder data with actual research findings
3. WHEN displaying risk data THEN the system SHALL highlight user-specific skills and occupation matches
4. WHEN no analysis data exists THEN the system SHALL continue showing placeholder data with a prompt to run analysis
5. WHEN new analysis completes THEN the tab SHALL automatically update with fresh data

### Requirement 5: Analysis Result Storage and State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my job risk analysis results to persist so that I can review them multiple times without re-running the analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN job risk analysis completes THEN the system SHALL store results in the chatbox analysis history
2. WHEN results are stored THEN they SHALL include metadata linking to the specific user profile version
3. WHEN the user returns to JobRiskAnalysisTab THEN the system SHALL load the most recent analysis results
4. WHEN the user's profile changes significantly THEN the system SHALL indicate that analysis may be outdated
5. WHEN multiple analyses exist THEN the user SHALL be able to access previous results through the analysis history

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable job risk analysis that handles errors gracefully so that I can still get insights even when some data sources are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ResearchDataService is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback analysis using cached data or general industry trends
2. WHEN occupation mapping fails THEN the system SHALL use broader industry-level risk data
3. WHEN AI analysis fails THEN the system SHALL present raw research data with basic interpretation
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry options and offline capabilities
5. WHEN partial data is available THEN the system SHALL generate analysis with appropriate confidence indicators

### Requirement 7: Performance and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast and responsive job risk analysis so that I can quickly understand my career risks without long wait times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is triggered THEN the initial response SHALL occur within 2 seconds
2. WHEN processing complex profiles THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and estimated completion time
3. WHEN analysis is running THEN the user SHALL be able to continue using other parts of the application
4. WHEN results are ready THEN the system SHALL provide clear notification and easy navigation to results
5. WHEN displaying results THEN the JobRiskAnalysisTab SHALL load and render within 1 second

### Requirement 8: Data Integration and Extensibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the job risk integration to be extensible so that we can easily add new data sources and analysis types in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the integration THEN the system SHALL use modular interfaces that support multiple data sources
2. WHEN new research data becomes available THEN the system SHALL be able to incorporate it without major refactoring
3. WHEN adding new analysis types THEN the existing architecture SHALL support extension through provider patterns
4. WHEN integrating with external APIs THEN the system SHALL use consistent error handling and caching strategies
5. WHEN scaling the system THEN the architecture SHALL support concurrent analysis requests and result caching
