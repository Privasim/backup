# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing UI generation system in MobileTab with a streamlined 3-step workflow: Prompt → Design Spec → Code Export. The system builds upon the current UIPromptBox and UIWireframeRenderer infrastructure while adding structured design specification generation, enhanced component rendering, and exportable code blueprints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Layout Architecture

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clear two-column layout for UI generation, so that I can see the preview and controls simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MobileTab loads THEN the system SHALL display a responsive 2-column grid layout
2. WHEN displaying the layout THEN the left column SHALL contain a phone preview frame
3. WHEN displaying the layout THEN the right column SHALL contain generation controls and spec viewer
4. WHEN the screen is narrow THEN the layout SHALL stack vertically while maintaining usability
5. IF generation is active THEN both columns SHALL update in real-time

### Requirement 2: Design Specification Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate structured design specifications from prompts, so that I have consistent and validated UI designs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a prompt THEN the system SHALL generate a DesignSpec JSON with streaming output
2. WHEN generating specs THEN the system SHALL include theme, components, layout, constraints, and accessibility fields
3. WHEN streaming specs THEN the system SHALL provide real-time parsing with incremental updates
4. WHEN specs are complete THEN the system SHALL validate against Zod schema
5. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL retry with refined prompts

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Component Rendering

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see rich mobile UI previews with expanded component support, so that I can evaluate designs effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering wireframes THEN the system SHALL support Navbar, Tabs, Chip, Stat, Avatar, Icon, and FormField components
2. WHEN applying styles THEN the system SHALL map design tokens to Tailwind utility classes
3. WHEN displaying components THEN the system SHALL provide basic interactivity (tab switching, button feedback)
4. WHEN rendering layouts THEN the system SHALL maintain mobile-first responsive design
5. IF components are unknown THEN the system SHALL display fallback placeholders

### Requirement 4: Code Blueprint Export

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to export generated UIs as React+Tailwind code, so that I can use them in my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN design specs are validated THEN the system SHALL enable code blueprint generation
2. WHEN generating blueprints THEN the system SHALL create exportable TSX with proper component structure
3. WHEN exporting code THEN the system SHALL include necessary dependencies and imports
4. WHEN blueprints are ready THEN the system SHALL provide download as ZIP functionality
5. IF generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages

### Requirement 5: Settings Integration and Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my generation settings and results to persist across sessions, so that I don't lose my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the system THEN API keys and model selection SHALL integrate with existing ChatboxSettings
2. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL cache results using stable input hashes
3. WHEN returning to the interface THEN previous specs and wireframes SHALL be restored
4. WHEN changing models THEN selection SHALL persist in localStorage with 'ui-prompt:selected-model' key
5. IF localStorage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade without caching

### Requirement 6: Performance and Streaming Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast, responsive UI generation with real-time feedback, so that I can iterate quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating specs THEN streaming SHALL provide sub-5-second initial feedback
2. WHEN parsing JSON THEN the system SHALL use incremental parsing with brace-balance detection
3. WHEN updating UI THEN setState calls SHALL be throttled to prevent performance issues
4. WHEN cancelling operations THEN abort controllers SHALL immediately stop all processing
5. IF streaming fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to non-streaming mode

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and recovery options when generation fails, so that I can understand and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display specific, actionable error messages
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic fields with suggestions
3. WHEN generation fails THEN the system SHALL offer retry with simplified prompts
4. WHEN API limits are hit THEN the system SHALL provide clear quota information
5. IF all retries fail THEN the system SHALL preserve partial progress and allow manual editing

### Requirement 8: Security and Code Safety

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure generated code is safe and never executed at runtime, so that the application remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating code THEN the system SHALL only create text output for export
2. WHEN rendering previews THEN the system SHALL never use eval() or dynamic code execution
3. WHEN handling user input THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate all content
4. WHEN managing API keys THEN the system SHALL use existing secure storage infrastructure
5. IF malicious content is detected THEN the system SHALL reject and sanitize the input
