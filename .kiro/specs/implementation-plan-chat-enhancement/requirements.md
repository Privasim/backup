# Implementation Plan Chat Enhancement - Requirements

## Overview
Transform the implementation plan generation into a two-phase, chat-based experience with vertical progress tracking and full integration with ChatboxControls for a natural, conversational AI interaction.

## Problem Statement
The current implementation plan streaming shows code-like content with horizontal progress bars that don't fit well in the tab layout. Users jump directly to full plan generation without seeing an outline first, and the experience is disconnected from the main ChatboxControls system.

## Goals
- Create a two-phase generation process (outline â†’ full plan)
- Integrate fully with existing ChatboxControls system
- Transform display into natural chat-like conversation
- Implement vertical progress tracking with better space utilization
- Provide user approval mechanism before full plan generation

## Non-Goals
- Changing the underlying ImplementationPlan data structure
- Modifying ChatboxControls core functionality
- Altering the OpenRouter integration patterns
- Breaking existing caching and storage mechanisms

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Two-Phase Generation Process
- **FR1.1**: Generate high-level outline first (5-10 seconds)
- **FR1.2**: Display outline in chat-like format with key sections
- **FR1.3**: Provide "Generate Complete Plan" action button
- **FR1.4**: Full plan generation only after user approval

### FR2: ChatboxControls Integration
- **FR2.1**: Route all LLM requests through existing ChatboxControls
- **FR2.2**: Use same API key, model, and configuration management
- **FR2.3**: Maintain consistent error handling and validation
- **FR2.4**: Preserve existing prompt customization capabilities

### FR3: Chat-Based Display
- **FR3.1**: Display content as natural conversation messages
- **FR3.2**: Show AI "thinking" and generation progress naturally
- **FR3.3**: Use chat bubbles and conversational language
- **FR3.4**: Eliminate code-like JSON displays during streaming

### FR4: Vertical Progress Layout
- **FR4.1**: Left sidebar with vertical progress indicators
- **FR4.2**: Main content area for chat-like plan display
- **FR4.3**: Section completion tracking in sidebar
- **FR4.4**: Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### FR5: Enhanced User Experience
- **FR5.1**: Clear outline approval workflow
- **FR5.2**: Smooth transitions between phases
- **FR5.3**: Professional chat-like appearance
- **FR5.4**: Consistent with other AI features in the app

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance
- **NFR1.1**: Outline generation completes within 10 seconds
- **NFR1.2**: Smooth streaming without UI blocking
- **NFR1.3**: Efficient memory usage during long generations

### NFR2: Integration
- **NFR2.1**: Zero breaking changes to ChatboxControls
- **NFR2.2**: Maintains existing caching behavior
- **NFR2.3**: Compatible with current settings and storage

### NFR3: Usability
- **NFR3.1**: Intuitive two-phase workflow
- **NFR3.2**: Clear visual feedback during generation
- **NFR3.3**: Accessible keyboard and screen reader support

## User Stories

### US1: As a user generating an implementation plan
**I want** to see a high-level outline first
**So that** I can review the approach before committing to full generation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Quick outline appears within 10 seconds
- Outline shows key sections and priorities
- Clear "Generate Complete Plan" action available

### US2: As a user reviewing the outline
**I want** the content displayed like a natural conversation
**So that** it feels like I'm chatting with an AI assistant

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Content appears in chat bubbles
- Natural language descriptions
- No code or JSON visible during generation

### US3: As a user tracking progress
**I want** to see which sections are being worked on
**So that** I understand the generation progress

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Vertical progress bar on left side
- Current section highlighted
- Completed sections marked clearly

## Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing ChatboxControls without modifications
- Cannot break current ImplementationPlan data structure
- Must maintain OpenRouter API usage patterns
- Should preserve existing caching and storage systems

## Success Metrics
- User approval rate for outlines > 80%
- Reduced cancellation during full generation
- Improved user satisfaction scores
- Consistent chat-like experience across features

## Dependencies
- Existing ChatboxControls system
- Current ImplementationPlan infrastructure
- OpenRouter client and streaming capabilities
- React context and state management
