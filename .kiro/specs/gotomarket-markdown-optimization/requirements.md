# Go-to-Market Markdown Generation Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

This enhancement optimizes the Go-to-Market V2 feature by switching from complex JSON generation to streamlined Markdown generation with configurable content length settings. This addresses the current issues of over-generation and processing complexity while providing users with flexible content control.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Markdown-Based Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want go-to-market strategies generated in Markdown format, so that the content is easier to read, process, and generate efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating strategies THEN the system SHALL use Markdown format instead of JSON
2. WHEN processing AI responses THEN the system SHALL parse Markdown content directly
3. WHEN displaying strategies THEN the system SHALL render Markdown content with proper formatting
4. IF the AI generates mixed content THEN the system SHALL extract and clean Markdown sections
5. WHEN exporting strategies THEN Markdown SHALL be the primary format with JSON as secondary

### Requirement 2: Content Length Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control the length and detail level of generated strategies, so that I can get concise or detailed content based on my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring generation THEN the user SHALL be able to select content length: Brief (3-5 sentences), Standard (6-9 sentences), or Detailed (10-12 sentences)
2. WHEN Brief is selected THEN each strategy section SHALL contain 3-5 sentences with key points only
3. WHEN Standard is selected THEN each strategy section SHALL contain 6-9 sentences with moderate detail
4. WHEN Detailed is selected THEN each strategy section SHALL contain 10-12 sentences with comprehensive information
5. IF no length is specified THEN the system SHALL default to Standard length

### Requirement 3: Simplified Strategy Structure

**User Story:** As a user, I want strategies organized in clear Markdown sections, so that I can easily navigate and understand the content without complex data structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN strategies are generated THEN they SHALL be organized in clear Markdown sections: Marketing, Sales, Pricing, Distribution
2. WHEN displaying strategies THEN each section SHALL have consistent formatting with headers, bullet points, and emphasis
3. WHEN processing content THEN the system SHALL extract key information without requiring complex JSON parsing
4. IF a section is missing THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with placeholder content
5. WHEN updating strategies THEN users SHALL be able to edit Markdown content directly

### Requirement 4: Settings Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want content length settings integrated into the generation options, so that I can easily control output verbosity alongside other preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing generation options THEN content length SHALL be available as a dropdown selection
2. WHEN changing content length THEN the setting SHALL persist for future generations
3. WHEN generating with different lengths THEN the prompt SHALL be adjusted accordingly
4. IF the user has a saved preference THEN it SHALL be pre-selected in the interface
5. WHEN exporting settings THEN content length preference SHALL be included

### Requirement 5: Improved Processing Performance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want faster and more reliable content processing, so that users experience quicker generation times and fewer parsing errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing Markdown responses THEN parsing SHALL be faster than JSON processing
2. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL require minimal post-processing
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be easier to debug with readable Markdown content
4. IF content is malformed THEN the system SHALL recover gracefully with partial content
5. WHEN streaming content THEN Markdown SHALL display progressively without waiting for complete JSON

### Requirement 6: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user with existing strategies, I want my current data to remain accessible, so that I don't lose previous work when the system is updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading existing JSON strategies THEN they SHALL be converted to Markdown format
2. WHEN exporting legacy data THEN both JSON and Markdown formats SHALL be available
3. WHEN importing old strategies THEN the system SHALL handle JSON format gracefully
4. IF conversion fails THEN the user SHALL be notified with recovery options
5. WHEN displaying converted strategies THEN formatting SHALL be preserved as much as possible
