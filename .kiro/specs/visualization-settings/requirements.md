# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a streamlined visualization settings system for the business idea implementation plan feature. The system allows users to customize the output format and visualization type while maintaining a clean architecture ready for future enhancements. Users can choose between Standard View and Vertical Timeline for implementation plans, with settings persisted across sessions and seamlessly integrated into the plan creation workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business user creating implementation plans, I want to select different visualization types for my plans, so that I can view the information in the format that best suits my workflow and presentation needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new implementation plan THEN the system SHALL provide a visualization type selector with Standard View and Vertical Timeline options
2. WHEN selecting a visualization type THEN the system SHALL immediately update the UI to reflect the selected option
3. WHEN generating an implementation plan THEN the system SHALL apply the selected visualization type to the output
4. WHEN switching between visualization types THEN the system SHALL preserve all plan data while changing only the presentation format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a frequent user of the implementation planning feature, I want my visualization preferences to be remembered across sessions, so that I don't have to reconfigure my settings every time I use the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting a visualization type THEN the system SHALL persist the setting in local storage
2. WHEN returning to the application THEN the system SHALL restore my previously selected visualization preferences
3. WHEN creating multiple plans in a session THEN the system SHALL maintain my visualization settings across all plan generations
4. IF no previous settings exist THEN the system SHALL default to Standard View

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user viewing implementation plans, I want the visualization to be responsive and performant regardless of the selected type, so that I can effectively review and interact with my plans on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing plans on mobile devices THEN both visualization types SHALL adapt to smaller screen sizes while maintaining readability
2. WHEN rendering large implementation plans THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth performance with optimized rendering
3. WHEN switching between visualization types THEN the transition SHALL be smooth with appropriate loading states
4. WHEN interacting with timeline visualizations THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive navigation and zoom capabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the visualization system, I want an extensible architecture that supports adding new visualization types, so that future enhancements can be implemented efficiently without major refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new visualization types THEN the system SHALL use a registry pattern that allows easy component registration
2. WHEN implementing visualization components THEN the system SHALL provide consistent interfaces and error handling
3. WHEN extending settings THEN the system SHALL support additional configuration options without breaking existing functionality
4. WHEN testing visualizations THEN the system SHALL provide isolated testing capabilities for each visualization type
