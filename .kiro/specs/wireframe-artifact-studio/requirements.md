# Wireframe Artifact Studio Requirements

## Introduction

Transform the existing artifact studio into a Claude Artifacts-like wireframe generation system that creates interactive, self-contained React wireframes from natural language prompts. The system should generate wireframes that are immediately interactive with state management, event handlers, and visual feedback.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Interactive Wireframe Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input a natural language prompt and receive an interactive wireframe that demonstrates the UI concept with working functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a prompt describing a UI concept THEN the system SHALL generate a self-contained JavaScript wireframe using React UMD globals
2. WHEN the wireframe is generated THEN it SHALL contain React.useState hooks for state management
3. WHEN the wireframe contains interactive elements THEN they SHALL have onClick, onChange, or onSubmit handlers that visibly update the UI
4. WHEN the wireframe is rendered THEN it SHALL use only Tailwind CSS classes for styling
5. WHEN the wireframe executes THEN it SHALL render into a #root element via ReactDOM.createRoot(...).render(...)
6. WHEN the wireframe is generated THEN it SHALL NOT contain any imports, exports, or external dependencies

### Requirement 2: Wireframe Validation and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically validate that generated wireframes are interactive and provide feedback when they're not.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a wireframe is generated THEN the system SHALL validate it contains React hooks, event handlers, and component structure
2. WHEN a wireframe fails validation THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with an improved prompt
3. WHEN retries fail THEN the system SHALL inject minimal interactivity to ensure the wireframe meets basic requirements
4. WHEN a wireframe is displayed THEN it SHALL show an interactivity badge indicating "Interactive", "Partially Interactive", or "Static"
5. WHEN a wireframe is not fully interactive THEN the system SHALL provide a "Regenerate with Interactivity" button

### Requirement 3: Secure Sandboxed Execution

**User Story:** As a user, I want generated wireframes to execute safely without access to external resources or the ability to compromise the parent application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a wireframe executes THEN it SHALL run in a sandboxed iframe with strict CSP policies
2. WHEN the sandbox loads THEN it SHALL only allow same-origin requests to local React UMD and CSS assets
3. WHEN the wireframe code executes THEN it SHALL NOT have access to network APIs, localStorage, or parent window
4. WHEN the sandbox encounters errors THEN it SHALL report them to the parent via postMessage without exposing sensitive information
5. WHEN the wireframe loads THEN it SHALL use a cryptographically secure nonce for inline script execution

### Requirement 4: Modal-Based User Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean, focused interface for wireframe generation that doesn't clutter the main application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access wireframe generation THEN it SHALL open in a modal dialog with prompt input and preview areas
2. WHEN I enter a prompt THEN the system SHALL show real-time progress indicators during generation
3. WHEN generation completes THEN the wireframe SHALL display in a resizable preview area with fullscreen capability
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be displayed with actionable error messages and retry options
5. WHEN I close the modal THEN it SHALL preserve the current wireframe for later viewing

### Requirement 5: AI Integration and Prompt Engineering

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to understand wireframe requirements and generate appropriate interactive components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system calls the AI THEN it SHALL use a specialized system prompt for wireframe generation
2. WHEN the AI generates code THEN it SHALL follow strict constraints for React UMD globals and no JSX
3. WHEN the prompt mentions specific UI patterns THEN the AI SHALL include appropriate interactivity (forms, toggles, counters, etc.)
4. WHEN the AI response is processed THEN the system SHALL extract only the first code block and validate it
5. WHEN generation fails THEN the system SHALL cache successful results to avoid redundant API calls

### Requirement 6: Performance and Caching

**User Story:** As a user, I want wireframe generation to be fast and not waste API calls on repeated requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I generate a wireframe THEN the system SHALL cache successful results by prompt and model combination
2. WHEN I request the same wireframe again THEN it SHALL return the cached result without calling the AI
3. WHEN the cache becomes full THEN it SHALL evict oldest entries using FIFO strategy
4. WHEN wireframes render THEN they SHALL load local assets efficiently without external network requests
5. WHEN I switch between wireframes THEN the transitions SHALL be smooth without unnecessary re-compilation

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when things go wrong and easy ways to recover from errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI generation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages with suggested actions
2. WHEN wireframe compilation fails THEN it SHALL show the error and offer to regenerate
3. WHEN runtime errors occur in the sandbox THEN they SHALL be captured and displayed without breaking the parent app
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
5. WHEN validation fails THEN it SHALL explain what's missing and offer automatic fixes

### Requirement 8: Accessibility and Responsive Design

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want generated wireframes to be keyboard accessible and screen reader friendly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN wireframes are generated THEN they SHALL include appropriate ARIA labels and roles
2. WHEN interactive elements are created THEN they SHALL be keyboard accessible with proper focus management
3. WHEN the wireframe modal opens THEN it SHALL trap focus and be dismissible with the Escape key
4. WHEN wireframes render THEN they SHALL be responsive and work on mobile and desktop viewports
5. WHEN color is used for information THEN it SHALL have sufficient contrast ratios for accessibility
