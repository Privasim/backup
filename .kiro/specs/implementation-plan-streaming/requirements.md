# Implementation Plan Streaming Enhancement - Requirements

## Overview
Enhance the implementation plan generation streaming experience by replacing raw JSON display with readable, progressive content rendering that provides users with meaningful feedback during generation.

## Problem Statement
Currently, the implementation plan streaming shows raw JSON code in a monospace font with poor contrast, making it difficult for users to follow the generation progress. Users see technical data structures instead of readable content, creating a poor user experience.

## Goals
- Transform raw JSON streaming into readable, formatted text display
- Provide progressive content revelation as sections are completed
- Improve visual design with better typography and contrast
- Maintain technical robustness while enhancing user experience
- Ensure accessibility and responsive design

## Non-Goals
- Changing the underlying JSON data structure
- Modifying the OpenRouter integration or API calls
- Altering the final plan display format
- Adding new plan sections or data fields

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Progressive Content Display
- **FR1.1**: Display readable text content as it streams, not raw JSON
- **FR1.2**: Show plan sections progressively as they become available
- **FR1.3**: Provide visual indicators for which section is currently being generated
- **FR1.4**: Handle partial content gracefully without breaking the UI

### FR2: Enhanced Visual Design
- **FR2.1**: Use dark gray text (`text-gray-700`) for better readability
- **FR2.2**: Replace monospace font with readable sans-serif typography
- **FR2.3**: Implement card-based layout for streaming sections
- **FR2.4**: Add smooth transitions between streaming states

### FR3: Content Processing
- **FR3.1**: Extract readable content from JSON chunks in real-time
- **FR3.2**: Format bullet points, titles, and descriptions appropriately
- **FR3.3**: Handle mixed content types (JSON, markdown, plain text)
- **FR3.4**: Maintain fallback to raw display if processing fails

### FR4: Progress Indication
- **FR4.1**: Show current generation phase (overview, phases, tasks, etc.)
- **FR4.2**: Display completion indicators for finished sections
- **FR4.3**: Provide estimated progress percentage when possible
- **FR4.4**: Maintain responsive feedback during long generations

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance
- **NFR1.1**: Real-time processing must not introduce noticeable lag
- **NFR1.2**: Memory usage should remain constant during streaming
- **NFR1.3**: UI updates should be smooth and non-blocking

### NFR2: Reliability
- **NFR2.1**: Graceful degradation when content processing fails
- **NFR2.2**: Robust handling of malformed or incomplete JSON
- **NFR2.3**: Error recovery without breaking the streaming experience

### NFR3: Accessibility
- **NFR3.1**: Screen reader compatible with proper ARIA labels
- **NFR3.2**: High contrast ratios for text readability
- **NFR3.3**: Keyboard navigation support for interactive elements

### NFR4: Maintainability
- **NFR4.1**: Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **NFR4.2**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **NFR4.3**: Type-safe implementation with proper TypeScript interfaces

## User Stories

### US1: As a user generating an implementation plan
**I want** to see readable, formatted content as it's being generated
**So that** I can follow the progress and understand what's being created

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Streaming content appears as formatted text, not raw JSON
- Text is easily readable with proper contrast and typography
- Content updates smoothly without jarring transitions

### US2: As a user waiting for plan generation
**I want** to see which section is currently being worked on
**So that** I have a sense of progress and estimated completion time

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Clear indicators show current generation phase
- Completed sections are visually marked as done
- Progress feels responsive and informative

### US3: As a user with accessibility needs
**I want** the streaming content to be screen reader accessible
**So that** I can follow the generation process regardless of visual ability

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Proper ARIA live regions for dynamic content
- Semantic HTML structure for screen readers
- High contrast text that meets WCAG guidelines

## Technical Constraints
- Must work with existing OpenRouter streaming implementation
- Cannot modify the final ImplementationPlan data structure
- Must maintain backward compatibility with current caching system
- Should not impact generation performance or reliability

## Success Metrics
- User engagement: Reduced cancellation rate during generation
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for streaming content
- Performance: No measurable impact on generation speed
- Reliability: Zero streaming failures due to content processing

## Dependencies
- Existing implementation plan feature infrastructure
- OpenRouter client streaming capabilities
- React context and state management system
- TypeScript type definitions for plan structure
