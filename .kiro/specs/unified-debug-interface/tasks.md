## Implementation Notes

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Layout System**: CSS Grid for main layout with Flexbox for internal panel layouts
2. **State Management**: React Context + useReducer for global state, custom hooks for panel-specific state
3. **Performance**: Virtual scrolling for logs, memoization for expensive operations, debounced updates
4. **Persistence**: localStorage for session data, IndexedDB for large debugging sessions
5. **Accessibility**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### Integration Points

1. **Existing Components**: Adapt QuizForm and DebugConsole components for panel layout
2. **Assessment Flow**: Remove navigation and loading screens, implement inline processing
3. **Research Integration**: Display research data within results panel constraints
4. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error boundaries and inline error display

### Performance Considerations

1. **Log Rendering**: Virtual scrolling for 10,000+ log entries
2. **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of old logs and session data
3. **Real-time Updates**: Efficient state updates with minimal re-renders
4. **Export Performance**: Background processing for large data exports

### Development Workflow

1. **Phase 1**: Core layout and basic functionality
2. **Phase 2**: Enhanced debugging features and logging
3. **Phase 3**: Performance optimization and polish
4. **Phase 4**: Testing and documentation

### Success Criteria

1. **Zero Navigation**: Complete assessment workflow without page changes
2. **Real-time Debugging**: All processing steps visible in debug console
3. **Performance**: Smooth operation with large log volumes
4. **Usability**: Intuitive interface for development and debugging
5. **Accessibility**: Full accessibility compliance for all users
