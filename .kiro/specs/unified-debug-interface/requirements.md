# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a unified debugging and development interface that consolidates the quiz form, debug console, and assessment results into a single screen layout. This approach eliminates page navigation, removes loading screens, and provides real-time visibility into all processing steps for enhanced debugging and development experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified Layout Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all components (quiz form, debug console, and results) visible on one screen, so that I can monitor the entire assessment process without losing context through page navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the interface SHALL display a three-panel layout
2. WHEN the layout is rendered THEN the quiz form SHALL occupy the left panel (40% width)
3. WHEN the layout is rendered THEN the debug console SHALL occupy the right panel (35% width)
4. WHEN the layout is rendered THEN the results area SHALL occupy the bottom panel (25% height)
5. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the layout SHALL remain responsive and functional
6. WHEN panels are displayed THEN each panel SHALL have clear visual boundaries and headers

### Requirement 2: Real-time Debug Console Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the debug console to show all processing logs in real-time, so that I can immediately see what's happening during the assessment process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the quiz form is interacted with THEN the debug console SHALL immediately display relevant logs
2. WHEN the assessment starts THEN the debug console SHALL show all processing steps in real-time
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the debug console SHALL immediately display error details with stack traces
4. WHEN the assessment completes THEN the debug console SHALL show completion logs
5. WHEN logs are generated THEN they SHALL be categorized by component (QuizForm, Analyzer, OpenRouter, etc.)
6. WHEN the debug console is active THEN it SHALL provide filtering, copying, and export functionality

### Requirement 3: Inline Results Display

**User Story:** As a developer, I want assessment results to appear in the bottom panel immediately after processing, so that I can see the output without navigating to a different page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the assessment completes successfully THEN the results SHALL appear in the bottom panel
2. WHEN results are displayed THEN they SHALL include risk score, analysis summary, and recommendations
3. WHEN results are shown THEN they SHALL include research data integration if available
4. WHEN results appear THEN the debug console SHALL remain visible for continued monitoring
5. WHEN results are displayed THEN they SHALL be formatted for easy reading within the panel constraints
6. WHEN no results are available THEN the bottom panel SHALL show a placeholder or empty state

### Requirement 4: Elimination of Loading States and Navigation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate loading screens and page navigation, so that I maintain full visibility of the process and can debug issues more effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN there SHALL be no separate loading screen
2. WHEN the assessment begins THEN there SHALL be no navigation to a different page
3. WHEN processing occurs THEN progress SHALL be shown through the debug console and inline indicators
4. WHEN the assessment completes THEN results SHALL appear inline without page navigation
5. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled inline without redirecting to error pages
6. WHEN the form is reset THEN the interface SHALL clear results and logs without page reload

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Development Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced debugging capabilities and development tools, so that I can efficiently identify and resolve issues during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interface loads THEN it SHALL provide easy access to all debugging tools
2. WHEN processing occurs THEN timing information SHALL be visible in the debug console
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN request/response details SHALL be logged and visible
4. WHEN data is processed THEN intermediate processing steps SHALL be logged
5. WHEN the interface is used THEN it SHALL provide export functionality for debugging sessions
6. WHEN development mode is active THEN additional diagnostic information SHALL be available

### Requirement 6: Responsive Design and Usability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the unified interface to be usable on different screen sizes, so that I can debug effectively regardless of my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the screen width is below 1200px THEN the layout SHALL stack vertically
2. WHEN panels are stacked THEN each panel SHALL maintain its functionality
3. WHEN the interface is resized THEN panel proportions SHALL adjust appropriately
4. WHEN panels are displayed THEN they SHALL have resizable boundaries
5. WHEN content overflows THEN appropriate scrolling SHALL be provided
6. WHEN the interface is used on mobile THEN it SHALL remain functional with touch interactions

### Requirement 7: State Management and Persistence

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the interface state to be maintained during development sessions, so that I don't lose debugging context when making changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN form data is entered THEN it SHALL persist during the session
2. WHEN debug logs are generated THEN they SHALL remain visible until manually cleared
3. WHEN results are displayed THEN they SHALL persist until a new assessment is run
4. WHEN the interface is refreshed THEN previous session data SHALL be restored if available
5. WHEN debugging sessions are exported THEN they SHALL include all relevant state information
6. WHEN the interface is reset THEN all panels SHALL return to their initial state

### Requirement 8: Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the unified interface to perform efficiently, so that debugging doesn't impact the assessment process performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logs are generated rapidly THEN the debug console SHALL handle them without performance degradation
2. WHEN large amounts of data are processed THEN the interface SHALL remain responsive
3. WHEN multiple panels are active THEN memory usage SHALL be optimized
4. WHEN long debugging sessions occur THEN the interface SHALL manage resources efficiently
5. WHEN the interface is used extensively THEN it SHALL not cause browser performance issues
6. WHEN data is exported THEN the process SHALL not block the interface

## Technical Considerations

### Layout Structure
- CSS Grid or Flexbox for responsive three-panel layout
- Resizable panel boundaries using CSS resize or custom drag handles
- Proper overflow handling for each panel

### State Management
- Unified state management for form data, debug logs, and results
- Real-time updates without page navigation
- Session persistence using localStorage or sessionStorage

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient log rendering with virtualization for large log volumes
- Debounced updates for rapid log generation
- Memory management for long debugging sessions

### Integration Points
- Seamless integration with existing QuizForm component
- Enhanced DebugConsole component with better layout integration
- Inline results rendering without separate assessment page

## Success Metrics

1. **Development Efficiency**: Reduced time to identify and debug issues
2. **User Experience**: No loading screens or page navigation delays
3. **Debugging Capability**: Complete visibility into all processing steps
4. **Performance**: Interface remains responsive during intensive debugging
5. **Usability**: Effective use across different screen sizes and development environments
